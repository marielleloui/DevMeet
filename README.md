## About DevMeet
DevMeet is a fictional startup that aims to provide a networking platform where developers, entrepreneurs, and investors can meet. To bring this vision to life, I have created a __full-stack web application__ that utilises the __Ruby on Rails framework__, combined with other tools and technologies which will be further described in this README.
